## Meeting Description Feature

This is a web application to provide meeting transcription service for mental health practitioners.

Due to the size of the dependencies, I separate this from the main backend.

Azure Web Service will be used to host the service. This may change in the future due to the limitation in disk space, the temporary solution is to use the pytorch that only support cpu.
